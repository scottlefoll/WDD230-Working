          <h2 class="home-headline-1">
            Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-1">
            Absolutely, this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
            found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more
            overall (parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all
            over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children
            will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly, we
            deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are
            rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you
            never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the
            rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes
            equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are
            unable to go for very long at all without telling stories: some of
            which are even true!
          </p>

          <h2 class="home-headline-2">
            Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I
            still come?
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
            element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
            certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
            years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
            and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting
            trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
            device (PFD). Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great
            time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk
            before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and
            do in the event that you fall out of the raft.What is included in
            the trip?We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This
            includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffel bag, small
            waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping
            chair. We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea
            and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours.
            You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts,
            two cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night
            before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. Three meals per day
            are provided, plus snacks.
          </p>

          <h2 class="home-headline-3">What do I need to bring?</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-3">
            The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes
            in the Canyon is to be prepared for both hot and dry and cold and
            wet. Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos. Quick dry
            shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you
            cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection
            on the neck. Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the best
            thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts, if you are
            naturally cold, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom.
            Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a
            base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick
            dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are
            cold, cotton if you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient
            when changing or going to the bathroom. Hat- large brim hat offers
            protection from the sun with a good quality strap. Sunglasses with
            strap socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun.
            Sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair
            of shoes you have hiked in before. Camper wear: Bring something
            comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs
            are all popular options. Sleep wear: You might choose to sleep in
            your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something
            comfortable to sleep in. Also bring a water bottle, small day pack
            for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin,
            waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm. Optional items: gloves, fleece
            jacket, towel, bandana, small pillow, camera equipment, book,
            watercolors, journal, and pen. Hygiene products: toothpaste,
            toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra
            eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo.
