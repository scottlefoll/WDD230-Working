        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          [I am in the midst of a pretty big career change: I’ve been an organic
          farmer for the last 12 years, and I’m working to become a software
          engineer. Even worse, I’m trying to do it at the age of 57. Yeah, I
          know. Nuts. This is a study blog of my journey to become a software
          developer. I am doing it as an exercise in self-reflection, as a
          journal of the journey, as a roadmap, and in order to document my
          skill level as it increases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am enrolled as a computer science student at BYU Idaho.
          In addition, I am working my way through “100 Days of Code” on Udemy
          by Angela Yu, the Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity, and
          self-studying for the Comptia A+ exam. Basically, I am in full-time,
          professional student mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spend all my time either doing class work for the university,
          working on my other certifications, watching videos about coding or
          reading coding books. I think it would be interesting and helpful to
          me to write about what I am doing, and it might be interesting and
          helpful to others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Basically, I find very cool and really useful tidbits or nuggets every
          day, which I notebook and save for myself. So I think others who are
          in the earlier phases of their coding adventure might benefit from
          reading about those. They could be as minor as a cool theme for VS
          Code or PyCharm, or as huge as the new PyScript front-end library. ]

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          [There are three intended audiences for this blog: 1. Others who are
          in the early stages of learning to become a software developer, or
          thinking about starting. 2. First-year programmers who can learn
          interesting tips and tricks; and 3. People who are specifically in my
          personal tech journey, and my skill set. An additional target audience
          may be potential employers, and job referrals. If this site has
          intrinsic interest, because of the quality of the ideas and the
          writing, then it can attract audiences from all of these segments.] )]

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          I am in the middle of a pretty dramatic career change. I’ve been an
          organic farmer for the last 12 years, growing healthy vegetables. It’s
          been a blast, and very rewarding, but it’s hard to bring up 5 kids on
          it financially. So, while we will keep farming, I’m leaving the
          vegetables to the rest of the family this year and working on another
          love of mine, something that I have always wanted to do - become a
          software engineer.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Even worse, I’m trying to do it in my fifties, at an age far older
          than the usual beginning programmer. Yeah, I know, it's a bit nuts.

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          It’s an exercise in self-reflection, a journal of the journey, a
          roadmap for myself and maybe others, and a means for me to assess my
          progress. And there is a sliver of a chance that it might get read by
          a potential employer someday.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am enrolled as a computer science student at BYU Idaho.
          In addition, I am working my way through “100 Days of Code” on Udemy
          and also the “Complete 2022 Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy, both
          well-regarded courses by Angela Yu that are exact online versions of
          two 12 week bootcamps she runs at The London App Brewery; the Deep
          Learning Nanodegree course on Udacity; I’m self-studying for the
          Comptia A+ exam in IT Support. I have some additional Python learning
          resources (Free Code Camp, The Odin Project, and Codecademy) that I
          use regularly.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Basically, I am in full-time, all-in, professional student mode. I

          coding books. I think it would be interesting and helpful to me to

          Almost daily I find very cool and really useful tidbits or nuggets,
          which I notebook and save for myself. So I think others who are in the

          about those.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Scott and I’m trying to change my life. I’m in my fifties,
          and I’m trying to switch from being an organic farmer to a
          professional software developer. Now before it sounds too crazy, I did
          coding work for about 4 years, but it was 20 years ago. It was all
          self-taught and only in something called Visual Basic.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          So I’m spending this entire year “retooling” (I think that’s a
          euphemism for swapping out gears and refurbishing the brain, just like
          you might do to a used computer).
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          I have a plan of “attack” - yeah, I’m a older American guy, so
          everything is in terms of conflict. I have lots and lots of people I
          follow on Twitter, channels I subscribe to on Youtube, blog feeds I
          get, and courses I am enrolled in. Probably too many, but I’m sure I’m
          overcompensating for my age handicap.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Oh, I’m also enrolled full time as a Computer Science major at Brigham
          Young University - Idaho. That’s what actually takes the majority of
          my time right now.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          That’s it. This site is the journal of that journey. One year from
          knowing very, very little to becoming as proficient as I can become.

        <p>[Written copy for the Page 2 here]</p>

        <h4>PyScript Released</h4>
        <p>
          Big news last week with the public release of PyScript, the python
          library that will allow python to easily handle and integrate
          front-end tasks of great complexity. This gives python developers
          quick access to all the libraries and capabilities of python from
          within the browser on the front-end.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Here is an article on pyscript from the people at Anaconda:
          <a
            href="https://anaconda.cloud/pyscript-python-in-the-browser"
            target="_blank"
            >PyScript: Python in the Browser</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's greatest strength is is extensibility. With so many
          incredibly bright scientists and mathmaticians using python for such a
          wide diversity of complex tasks, they end up creating libraries that
          then become publicly available.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Python Speed Boost</h4>
        <p>
          Python is getting a big speed boost. In another big announcement, the
          release of CPython was delivered in San Francisco. A response to the
          2021 priority goal from Guido van Rossum of boosting python's speed by
          up to 200% jumped the development of CPython. Written in C, it gives
          direct api access to foundational C program calls.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p class="bottom-para">
          "I want Python to be more effective for large projects, without losing
          sight of its use for small projects and teaching," says Python creator
          Guido van Rossum.

          could be considered a "loyal" customer. And, to top it off, I got this

        <h4>Javascript Tricks and Tips.</h4>

        <p>
          I'm starting today with my first Javascript tips. I would love any
          feedback, or if anyone has any suggestions for me. I'm convinced that
          the best way for me to become really familiar with these tips and
          tricks is to publish them for others, and basically instruct on them.
          For me, that has always been the fastest path to understanding and
          competency.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Swap Two Variables</h4>
        <p>
          My first tip is very simple, but very useful. Use this snippet to swap
          the values of 2 variables with the least code: <br /><br />
          var x = 6;<br />
          var y = 7;<br />
          [x,y] = [y,x]<br />

          console.log(x,y) // 7 6
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <h4>Sort a String Array Alphabetically</h4>
        <p>
          Use this little bit of code to quickly and easily sort a string array:
          <br /><br />

          function alphabetSort(arr)<br />
          {<br />
          return arr.sort((a, b) = a.localeCompare(b))<br />
          }<br />
          let array = ["d", "c", "b", "a"]<br />
        </p>
        <p></p>

          "I would like to give the folks at Free Code Camp a shout out. That
          website has been so useful to me in so many ways. They have a huge
          colection of training materials: video tutorials, articles, code
          exercises. They also have a multitude of certifications that are
          well-respected in the industry. I love what these guys do, and I hope
          to help out some day.
